# Dicee

## Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to recreate the Dice application using Apple's new SwiftUI

## What I created

A Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking your phone. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!


## What I learned

* How to create a SwiftUI app with functionality
* More practice creating layouts
* Work with spacers and padding
* Creating subviews with properties that can change
* How SwiftUI manages State
